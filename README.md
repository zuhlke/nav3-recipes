# Navigation 3 - Code recipes
[Jetpack Navigation 3](https://goo.gle/nav3) is a library for app navigation. This repository contains recipes for how to 
use its APIs to implement common navigation use cases.

## Recipes
These are the recipes and what they demonstrate. 

**Basic API examples**
- **[Basic](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/basic)**: Shows most basic API usage.
- **[Saveable back stack](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/basicsaveable)**: As above, with a persistent back stack.
- **[Entry provider DSL](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/basicdsl)**: As above, using the entryProvider DSL.

**Layouts and animations**
- **[Material adaptive](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/scenes/materiallistdetail)**: Shows how to use a Material list-detail layout. 
- **[Custom Scene](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/scenes/twopane)**: Shows how to create a custom layout using a `Scene` and `SceneStrategy`.
- **[Animations](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/animations)**: Override the default animations for all destinations and a single destination.

**Common use cases**
- **[Common navigation UI](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/commonui)**: A common navigation toolbar where each item in the toolbar navigates to a top level destination.
- **[Conditional navigation](app/src/main/java/com/example/nav3recipes/conditional)**: Switch to a different navigation flow when a condition is met. For example, for authentication or first-time user onboarding.

**Planned**
- **Deeplinks**: Create and handle deeplinks to specific destinations
- **Android XR**: Custom navigation and layout behavior for Android XR
- **Returning a result from a destination**: Return a result to a previous destination
